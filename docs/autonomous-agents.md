# Autonomous agents and remote control

TermX runs tasks and schedules in the host process. Closing a browser, losing a
remote connection, or hiding the desktop window does not stop that process.
The host must remain awake and running. Quitting the desktop app stops its
backend; launch at login starts it again after signing in. To keep a host running
independently of the desktop shell, run `termx` under the operating system's
process supervisor with a persistent `TERMX_CONFIG_DIR`. Computer control also
requires an accessible graphical desktop session.

## Set up unattended work

1. Configure an AI connection in **Settings → AI & Models** and select it in a
   conversation with the intended project, engine and model.
2. For internal agents, an agent preset can select **Autonomous within host
   policy**. This uses the configured sandbox and tool policies. Browser handoff,
   sensitive actions, missing capabilities and exhausted budgets can still need
   a user decision.
3. In **Automations → New scheduled task**, select the conversation, task prompt,
   success criteria, recurrence, run count, time budget and grant expiry. Select
   **Allow unattended runs within these limits** and create the schedule.
4. The unattended grant starts an internal Agent-mode plan automatically. It does
   not approve unrelated tool actions or increase the budget. Scheduled command
   jobs can run saved, explicitly authorized command steps without a model.
5. Use **Task supervision → Build agent team** on an active local internal
   Agent-mode coordinator to add workers. Editable workers get isolated
   workspaces; read-only workers inspect the authorized project. Team capacity
   and execution time are bounded across the parent and children.

An unattended grant expires within 90 days and is bounded by its run count.
Changing its owner permissions or execution target invalidates it. Revocation
stops active runs and their descendants. Internal execution checks delegated
authority before planning, model turns, tool execution and checkpoint recovery;
the scheduler also reconciles active authority while work is in flight.

Slow provider planning does not block other schedules or remote cancellation.
The daemon admits at most eight concurrent schedule dispatches. Overlap policy
either skips an occurrence or retains one queued occurrence.

## Control work remotely

Connect to the host's HTTPS URL through a configured supported tunnel or private
network and sign in with a managed TermX account. The same workspace exposes
task history, approvals, team creation, steering and cancellation. Authorization
applies to each request and live socket. Reconnecting replays persisted events.
Revoking a session closes its sockets and rejects its subsequent requests.

**Pause** stops future scheduled occurrences. **Stop run** cancels a current run,
including one still planning. **Revoke and stop runs** revokes unattended
authority and cancels active work. Archiving retains history and does not stop an
already active run.

## Browser and computer tools

The internal engine exposes managed browser tools through the task broker.
Hand a built-in browser tab to the specific task before it can observe or act.
Actions follow the current review policy. Taking over a tab or revoking the
session removes agent access. A new scheduled task needs its own handoff; an
unattended schedule does not inherit an old task's browser grant.

Computer-capable model connections expose desktop screenshots and input. Agent
mode and the host's screen/input permissions are required. Linux X11, Windows
and macOS use their platform backends; native Wayland input is not supported.
Native engine capabilities differ: choosing Codex does not automatically supply
the internal engine's browser, computer or team tools.

## Restart behavior and live verification

Schedule definitions, run reservations, task IDs and events are durable. Restart
reconciles a known task ID; it never automatically repeats an ambiguous dispatch.
Internal checkpoints can reuse committed results or resume a prepared call.
A possibly executed side effect requires explicit recovery confirmation. Native
engines follow their own supported session-resume contract.

Live acceptance harnesses run actual hosts and network clients:

- `tests/workspace_remote_control_e2e.py`: independent authenticated clients,
  disconnect/reconnect, task teams, cancellation, revocation and real Bash PTY.
- `tests/workspace_autonomy_e2e.py`: daemon scheduling and process restart with
  durable state and actual harmless command effects.
- `tests/workspace_schedules_e2e.py`: rendered desktop schedule controls and
  execution while the browser is closed.

The harnesses explicitly identify scripted model adapters. They establish host
and tool behavior, not successful model inference, external phone connectivity,
or qualification of an installed native application on every platform. A release
claim for those capabilities needs the corresponding real provider, network and
device run.
